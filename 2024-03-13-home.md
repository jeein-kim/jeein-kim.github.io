**Howdy!** 

## Introduction

Hi! I'm Jeein Kim, a Ph.D. Student in Yonsei University. 

I am working with Aeree Chung, investigating in HI emission and radio properties of local hard X-ray AGN host galaxies, to reveal how the central AGN activity affect to the host galaxyâ€™s cool gas reservoir (feedback) and vis versa (feeding). I am mainly interested in resolved HI properties of nearby extragalaxies.
